            <p>Founded in 1947 in the French Alps, Salomon started out by making ski equipment and only ventured into skiwear and clothing much later; the brand didn’t start producing footwear until 1992, in the form of hiking shoes. Five years later, Salomon was acquired by Adidas, was eventually sold to Amer Sports in 2005, as the German brand was moving away from winter sports gear. 

            </p>
            <p>Salomon’s astronomical rise in popularity can be partly attributed to the Covid-19 pandemic. During lockdowns, hiking was an easy way for people to leave the confines of their homes while remaining socially distanced. Salomon, being a dominant name in outdoor gear, quickly gained traction and became an essential footwear for people’s new found love for the outdoors. People got to experience the comfort and functionality of Salomon sneakers and many were persuaded to wear them off the trails as well. </p>
